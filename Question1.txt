Question1:
    On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one 
    model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When
    we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. 
    Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, 
    something seems wrong with our analysis.

    a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.
        
        Answer:
        Base on the question, Average Order Value (AOV) = Total Revenue / Number of Orders, and the data is taken from 100 sneaker shops over
        30 day window. AOV is basically the mean order value, but the mean can be misleading sometimes. Mean is very sensitive to outliers or skewness.
        As we can see, there are some orders with very large value in our dataset (for example order 17 have order_amount=704000), so our dataset 
        is skewed to the right, the outliers will pull our AOV to the right and result in an AOV that is actually much higher than the point 
        where most data points cluster around.
        


    b. What metric would you report for this dataset?

        Answer:
        I would report the median of order value over all orders from 100 sneaker shops over 30 day window, because our dataset contains many
        outliers that have values significantly higher than the rest of the data, the median is more robust to outliers and will give a better
        estimate of the center.



    c. What is its value?

        Answer:
        Median of order value = 256, calculated using excel formula "=MEDIAN(D2,D5001)".
